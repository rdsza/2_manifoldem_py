"""
This code assumes that the datasets are stored in NumPy arrays and 
are already properly aligned (e.g., they have the same number of features). 
The SpectralEmbedding function from scikit-learn's manifold module is used to 
perform the spectral embedding, and the resulting fused dataset 
is stored in the X_fused array. Finally, the X_fused array is split back 
into the original datasets using indexing.
